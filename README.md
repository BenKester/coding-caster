# Coding Caster
Celebration of programming, math, and gaming
## Setup
The easiest way to set up the project is with Conda. From your command line, run
    conda env create -f environment.yml
Then activate the environment with
    conda activate coding-caster
The libraries might work fine with pip should you prefer that tool.
