# Coding Caster
Celebration of programming, math, and gaming  
## Setup
The easiest way to set up the project is with Conda. From your command line, run  
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```  
Then activate the environment with  
```bash
conda activate coding-caster  
```
The libraries might work fine with pip should you prefer that tool.
